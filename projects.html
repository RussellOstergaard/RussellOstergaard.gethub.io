                            This is my 131 Pyrdle project. The point of this project was to introduce us to more python commands and help us make a interactive program. 
                            It was also meant to get us familiar opening up txt files for reading and using the informantion within the text files. What I did for this project was take the txt
                            file which was a list of words have one word per spot in a array then pick one of the words at random to use for the word you'd have to guess. Then you are put into
                            the game where you have 6 guesses to try and get the word. If you get a letter in the correct spot then it turns green otherwise if it is in the word but not the 
                            correct spot it turns yellow. If the letter is not in the word it doesn't change color. It runs in a loop until you hit either 6 guesses or guess the word which at
                            that point it prints out "You Win" or "The Word Was: ____" and "You Lose".
