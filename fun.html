                            <p>One of my hobbies is Motorcycling. I started ridinging in 2021 down in Arizona while I was going to school. I've had two motorcycles; My First one was a KTM RC 390 which
                                 I whipped around the mountians in Arizona on. My second and current one is a Suzuki GSXR 600 which I have had for a year and a half</p>

                            <p>My last hobby is hockey. I've played hockey since I was 4 all the way up through highschool. Since college I have not played on a team but I have played outdoor with some
                                 of my buddies. For the most part now I just follow professional hockey and keep up with the wild.</p>
